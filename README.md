## Project Requirements

### Intern Data Management:
   Store all intern data in a static JSON object that is embedded or loaded into the application.
    Provide an interface to display intern details, such as name, department, and location, pulled from the JSON object.

### Randomized Scheduling:
   
The application should randomly generate a schedule that pairs or groups interns according to specified rules.

### Pairing rules should include:
 
Different city pairing: Interns are paired with others from different cities.

### Different department pairing:

 Interns are paired with others from different departments.
    Users should be able to turn these rules on or off depending on their requirements.
